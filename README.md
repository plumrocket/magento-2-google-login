## How it works
 
Once you've added the Login with Google button to your website, it shows up on all login and registration forms. Your site visitors can register or sign in by providing their existing Google account login and password. They also have the option to create a new account with Google.
 
In addition to logging in with Google, the extension provides the following features:

* Automatically retrieve user profile data such as email, user profile photo, gender, birth date, and more, which makes it easy for marketers to target and message this audience.
* Display a user profile photo retrieved from their Google account anywhere on your website and personalize the user experience.
* When customers like your product, they can share it with their friends on social media, which drives more social traffic and increases sales.
* Shop faster and easier than ever before by using the Google login button at checkout!
* Incerase sign-ups by implementing free built-in popup login. 

Sign-up and registration is necessary but sometimes difficult process. Entering data again and again at every new site you visit can be error-prone and tedious. We designed our registration and sign-up process with Google with three goals: security, ease of use, and user experience. This way, our customers will only enter the minimum amount of information needed, eliminate typing errors by entering information quickly, and cut down on registrations and account creations across your website.
